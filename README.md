# Google-Project-Sunroof
As the price of installing solar has gotten less expensive, more homeowners are turning to it as a possible option for decreasing their energy bill. Google wants to make installing solar panels easy and understandable for anyone. Project Sunroof puts Google's expansive data in mapping and computing resources to use, helping calculate the best solar plan for customers. Project Sunroof computes how much sunlight hits your roof in a year. It takes into account: • Google's database of imagery and maps • 3D modeling of your roof • Shadows cast by nearby structures and trees • All possible sun positions over the course of a year • Historical cloud and temperature patterns that might affect solar energy production Project Sunroof recommends an installation size to generate close to 100% of your electricity use, based on roof size, the amount of sun hitting the roof, and your electricity bill.
